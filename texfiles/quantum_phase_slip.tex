\section{Quantum phase slip \cite{mooij2005} \label{sec:qps}}

\subsection{Literature}
\begin{framed}\noindent
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \cite{degraf2018}  \textbf{Charge control of blockade  of Cooper
      pair tunnelling in highly disordered TiN nanowires in an inductive
      environment}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Fabricate several thin superconducting bridges with meanders;
    \item Measure the  DC voltage, $ V  $, acorss then as  a function of
      the applied gate voltage, $ V_c $, from underneath the chip;
    \item Some samples have big oscillations  in $ V $ with gate voltage
      - Single  Electron Transistor regime, where  nanowire is compoased
      of grains, which feel a Coulomb Blockade;
    \item Quantum Phase Slip possible  in other samples, where there are
      no grains in the wire.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{framed}

Initially quantum  phase slips  were a result  of thermal  activation in
thin wires.

\subsection{Cooper box duality}
The system  is dual to  the cooper pair  box system, where  the charging
energy  creates  a parabollic  dependence,  and  the Josephson  coupling
energy   $   E_J    $   mixes   states   lifting    degeneracy   as   in
Sec~\ref{sec:cooper_pair_box}:

 \begin{equation}\label{key}
   \mathcal{H} = E_c(\hat{n} - n_g)^2 - \frac{E_J}{2}\left[\iketbra{n+1}{n} + \iketbra{n}{n+1}\right].
 \end{equation}

 \noindent In the qunatum phase slip, we do the same thing, but now with
 inductor energy, $  E_L = \frac{\Phi_0^2}{2L} $, and couping,  $ E_s $,
 due  to the  tunneling  of fluxes  (we  do not  specify  yet the  exact
 derivation of this energy):

 \begin{equation}\label{key}
   \mathcal{H} = E_L(\hat{n} - f)^2 - \frac{E_s}{2}\left[\iketbra{n+1}{n} + \iketbra{n}{n+1}\right],
 \end{equation}

 \noindent with $ f = \Phi/\Phi_0 $.

 \begin{framed}\noindent
   \noindent  The discussion  them stems  off into  how the  Cooper pair
   tunneling is  dual to the phase  slip, how one gets  similar steps in
   voltage current  characterisitics. There  is a lot  of math,  which I
   don't want to get into.
