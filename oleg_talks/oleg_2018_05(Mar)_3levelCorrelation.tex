 \section{Oleg Talk 22nd March}
  Oleg proposed measuring correlation of three level atom:
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Excite the atom;
  	\item Measure \iket{2}\ra\iket{1} and \iket{1}\ra\iket{0} relaxation. Split output line and downconvert two photons individually. Then measure correlation.
  \end{itemize}

 Idea is that the 10 photon cannot exist unless 21 exists.
