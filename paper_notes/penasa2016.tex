 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item Pass in Rydberg atoms into cavity;
 		\item Interact for time $ T_1 $ and then allow Rabi oscillations to occur;
 		\item Apply a pulse in the middle of the cavity, to abruptly shift the phase by $ \pi $ and reverse the evolution;
 		\item Readout the state after time $ T_2 $. It should be undergoing Rabi oscillations as well. 
 		\item \textbf{At this point, the superposed state has an interntal phase shift between its component states \ra project them for a readout of states \iket{e} or \iket{g}};
 		\item Classically it is proven that the accuracy of the states is $ \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{No readings}}}$, but what is calculated is below this limit.
 		\item \red{This is a result of using a cavity-atom entangled quantum state that is non classical}.
